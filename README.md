# Entry 1: Introduction to Java

## What is Java?
Back in the day, the 90's, java was used for website development for big enterprises. Huge tech companies combined forces and created a programming language for their own use. Java is considered very difficult to use back then but later became more simple. Today Java is still used for website development but is used more for application development now. Java is an object-oriented language that tries to have the least amount of implementations as possible.

## What Do You Need To Start?
Java is considered a legacy programming language and can be coded using a terminal and a notepad file. This is not recommended for beginners and instead should use a JDK. A JDK consists of tools and classes already made for basic usage. Another thing that should be considered is an IDE. An IDE is an interface that finds bugs and errors within java. An IDE is basically cloud9.

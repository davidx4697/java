# Entry 2: Using Google

## Googling
The fundamental building blocks for learning such a difficult language like Java in such a short period of time is correct usage of time. Using google, one can learn the basics of Java in their own time and speed. Googling, I found that a website, codeacademy, offers several lessons on Java. Codeacademy is completely free and allows the user to learn the basics in their own pace.

## System Print
Since Java was originally a front-end language, I thought learning system print was important. Through codeacademy I learned the types of system prints. 

The basic system print is this 
```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello world!");
  }
}
```
#### What Does this Mean?

>public status void main

All Java programs start with the main method.

>println

There is two types of system prints that I have learned so far. There is ```...print``` and ```...println```. ```println``` makes sure to print the following text in the quotation marks,```("Hello world!")```, in a new line while ```...print``` returns the value in the quotation marks on the same line.

## Variables
Unlike p5js Java variables must be identified. For example a variable with a numerical value will start like this ```int variable=7;```

Variables with boolean values must have the word 'boolean' before the variable name. 

## Takeaways
Java is a very sensitive language in terms of identifying variables. Whitespace in the other hand does not affect code. Another thing that should be kept in mind is that semicolons must be added to the end of a line or it will return an error.
